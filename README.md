## Tree swallow corticosterone and weather

This analysis is trying to get a handle on how weather (particularly temperature) is related ot corticosterone in tree swallows. Samples are from adults and nestlings measured in Ithaca from 2013-2020. Samples collected after direct manipulations are excluded, but some samples after manipulations that we don't think had any impact on cort are still included.
